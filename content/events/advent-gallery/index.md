## Community Gallery Event

St Leonard's is thrilled to host a community gallery event exploring Advent themes of **light | hope | presence**.

We warmly invite contributions from local artists of any age or ability to our first ever St Leonard's Advent Gallery event.

**When:** From 7pm on Thursday 18th Dec at the St Leonard's Centre

Any medium is welcome – paintings, photography, sculpture, textiles, music, poetry, and more.

All contributions must be submitted by **Sunday 14th Dec**.

To submit your artwork or for more information, please contact Revd Ben Kautzer (ben@oww.church).

*"A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn."*

*"The light shines in the darkness  
and the darkness has not overcome it."*
